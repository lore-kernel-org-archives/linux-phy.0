How are you? I hope you're feeling better now....
I see you were more active on the Mailinglist in last time :)

Have you found some time (and were you able) to look a bit into this ([1])?

How would be the right way here? Daniel posted generic infrastructure for standalone
pcs drivers [2] similar to phy to have a generic base which all drivers can use and
which can be extended if needed.

There was some discussion about how pcs should handle if the underlaying device is removed...
unlikely on SoC, but possible on external bus devices like mdio or pcie. Imho this could be
a callback in common code handled by vendor driver (query information from mac driver or for
SoC simply return fixed value).

How should the subsystems talk with each other (callbacks, shared memory, ...)?

DT maintainers want to avoid syscon compatibles which are widely used for nodes representing only
a register range that is used from different subsystems. As we are currently upstreaming mt7988
(e.g. ethernet), there are some of these "devices" which currently have no own driver and only
handled by syscon driver to get the regmap. Should we really write different drivers with additional
compatibles (duplicate code!) only to handle exchange of the regmap between subsystems? For mt7988
which can have up to 7 syscon devices it is maybe better to have substructures like phy, pcs and so on
packed into an own driver to have a better overview in devicetree. But for some functional blocks
imho it makes not much sense (when really only a regmap has to be exchanged between different devices).

Daniel needs an answer to his questions in [1] (and [2]) on how to proceed. So please help to get the
pcs-part into the right shape.

regards Frank
