Nicolas, can you please rebase this series on the latest linux-next?

All that you have to do is resend everything as-is, but drop patch [14/24], as the
same thing that you've done there landed in form of..

https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/next/linux-next.git/commit/drivers/ufs/host/ufs-mediatek.c?h=next-20260213&id=bbb8d98fb4536594cb104fd630ea0f7dce3771d6

Besides. It feels like we're again playing a resend-and-nobody-cares game again
with this UFS driver.

I want to remind everyone that we've been trying to cleanup this thing for more
than a year and that our patches keep getting mostly ignored, if not for some
random nitpick here and there. (we: as I myself tried to clean it up a year ago
with my own patches that I had sent to the list - multiple versions of those)

Expressing my huge frustration here: at this point I'm not even sure why we keep
trying to make this right, other than being stubborn about feeling the need to
have good stuff in the kernel, instead of downstream code dumps which should've
never landed in the first place.

Though everyone here is human, and humans make mistakes (a lot), that's fine: the
problem happens when people negate mistakes, don't fix those, and don't care (not
because of lack of time, but because not caring at all, again - we've tried to do
those cleanups for a year now). One. Year.
Actually, more than one year, I don't even remember anymore.

This is not good behavior in a community, and should never happen.

Yet, here we are. Again. On the same driver. In the same subsystem.

Oh well.

Regards,
Angelo
