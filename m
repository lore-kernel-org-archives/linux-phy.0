Hi Russel / netdev

how can we proceed here? development for mt7988/Bpi-R4 is stalled here
because it is unclear what's the right way to go...

We want to avoid much work adding a complete new framework for a "small"
change (imho this affects all SFP-like sub-devices and their linking to
phylink/pcs driver)...if this really the way to go then some boundary
conditions will be helpful.

regards Frank
