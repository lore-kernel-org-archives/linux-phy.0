Sorry to hear that, but if it's any consolation, you're not alone. On
new year's eve, I had three teeth extracted, including one that was
laying horizontally in the palate of the mouth buried in bone, and
needed in bone graft (modern bone grafts are quite different from what
you'd expect btw.) It's been quite sore/painful as it heals.

Thanks for testing!

Given the results you've given, my suggestion would be that the
following patches are probably the most risky:

Patch 2 "net: stmmac: qcom-ethqos: convert to set_clk_tx_rate() method"

This changes the way the clock is configured. It would be worth
testing that and giving a tested-by for the first two patches if
that's successful.

Patch 6 "net: stmmac: qcom-ethqos: convert to dwmac generic SerDes
support"

This changes how the SerDes is handled, which is a significant change.
It's possible that the PHY calibration needs some other state to be
appropriately configured, and that's not happening in the same order.

Either of these two would account for what appears to be an unstable
SerDes link.

As for the NULL pointer deref, I'll look at that in a bit (waiting
for a build to complete so I can hopefully pinpoint where the oops
is happening.)
