So what is the rule then? I understand the logic of describing the
pins eg. for uart1 only on board-level as there are actual alternatives
regarding the pins to be used, and if also including RTS/CTS pins.
Hence, for uart1, there are several possible pingroups which can be
used. What would be the argument to keep a pinctrl description for
which the SoC doesn't offer any alternatives to be on the board-level?
There is nothing to be decided by the board, literally 0 freedom.

Note that the patch you have just added your Reviewed-by:-tag to does
*not* add the uart0 pinctrl on SoC-level but board-level, so different
from what I argued for above. Did you mean to add Reviewed-by: for that
(which contraticts what you just wrote) or rather to the to-be-submitted
v2 of this series which includes the change to move the uart0 pinctrl
to mt7981b.dtsi?
