Understood. One issue that I see is that we certainly can not use the
first argument for representing state as it will result in errors for
current users.

I feel that the safest way to go would be by using a second argument to
represent the state or to represent multiple states can be used by the
driver. The issue that I see with this approach is that currently the
fist argument is used to select the line number from the mux and if the
we use two arguments like this,

mux-controls = <&mux 0 -1>

then this would mean that line nnumber 0 in the mux could use multiple
states and for a driver to use mutiple lines we would need to add an
entry for each line which would bloat the code a well increase the
complexity in the drivers while using devm_mux_get(). So, one solution
that I could think of is to use a "-1" for the first argument too. This
would indicate that the driver would need to toggle multiple lines in
the mux

For example,

1) mux-controls = <&mux -1 3> // the driver would need to set the mux
lines to 3 for enabling it

2) mux-controls = <&mux -1 -1> //the driver would need to set the mux
lines and multiple states in the mux

3) mux-controls = <&mux 0 1> // the driver would need to set the zeroth
mux line to 1

I do see that, going with this method would make <&mux ^\d*$ ^\d*$>(i.e.
any positive number in the first argument) redundant as it can be
represented with <&mux -1 *>. However, I think is the only way so that
existing users will not see issues.

Understood, I will try to add changes in the common mux-controller
bindings itself and then reference it in the gpio-mux bindings
