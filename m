Hi Frank,

Sorry, but I've not been able to look at this, and I've completely lost
all context now. I was diverted onto a high priority work issue for a
while (was it from April to end of June) so didn't have much time
available for mainline work. I then had a much needed holiday (three
weeks) in July. I then had a clear week where I did look at mainline.
Since then, I've had two cataract operations that have made being on the
computer somewhat difficult, and it is only recently that I'm
effectively "back" after what is approximately six months of not having
a lot of bandwidth. I've seen the cataract consultant this morning, and
just found out that my optometrist appointment for Tuesday is too soon
after the cataract operation, and needs to be moved two weeks. The
optometrist doesn't have availability then, so it's going to be another
four weeks. FFS... I wish I'd known, then I could've made an
arrangement with the optometrist months ago for the correct date.

Now, XPCS has introduced a hack in a similar way to what you're trying
to do, but I wasn't able to review it, so it went in. We're heading
towards the situation where every PCS driver is going to have its own
way to look up a PCS registered as a device. This is not going to scale.

We need something better than this - and at the moment that's all I can
say because I haven't given it any more thought beyond that so far.
