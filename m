Ack, I was going to clean this up later and wanted to get feedback on 
this entire approach first. Won't be used anymore when moving to a 
glue.h based approach anyway.

This is actually a leftover from the first attempts at making this work. 
I didn't know about the external reset line back then and had to 
soft-reset it here because it would not see new devices otherwise IIRC.
Since we're going through a hard-reset now anyway this can be dropped
and this entire commit will disappear in favor of a glue.h based driver 
anyway.

The only place we actually need it is when we shut down the Type-C PHY 
due some what I assume is some hardware quirk, i.e. just before 
dwc3_core_exit.

The PHY will otherwise not be able to acquire some hardware lock (which 
they call PIPEHANDLER lock in debug strings) to switch from e.g. USB3 
PHY to a dummy PHY for USB2 only. It then can't shut down cleanly 
anymore and will get stuck in a weird state where the port refuses to 
work until I reset everything.
Originally it was added because we just undid some commit where susphy 
handling was made unconditional IIRC.

I'll move this to the glue driver with a comment explaining why it's 
required.

Ack, will also happen from inside the glue driver now.
