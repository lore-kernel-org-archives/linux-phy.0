From the schematics [1]
https://dn.odroid.com/S805/Schematics/odroid-c1+_rev0.4_20160226.pdf

You could find references to PWREN  <--- GPIOAO.BIT5
The second reference is USB HOST Power Switch
The third reference is USB HOST POWER.

Hope I am clean in my thought process now.

Yep, you are correct, If I used GPIOAO_13 wrong pin, it will not
enable the USB power. See below.
[alarm@archl-c1e ~]$ sudo cat /sys/kernel/debug/gpio | grep usb
 gpio-1953 (USB_HUB_RST_N       |usb-hub-reset       ) out hi

So correct way with  gpios = <&gpio_ao GPIOAO_5 GPIO_ACTIVE_LOW>;

[alarm@archl-c1e linux-amlogic-5.y-devel]$ sudo cat
/sys/kernel/debug/gpio | grep usb
 gpio-1953 (USB_HUB_RST_N       |usb-hub-reset       ) out hi
 gpio-1954 (USB_OTG_PWREN       |regulator-usb-pwr-en) out lo ACTIVE LOW

The reason for USB ports has power without this patch is applied.
Please check schematics S805 USB2 SDB
USB_VDD33 is powered with VDDIO_AO3V3 regulator directly along with SD CARD.

OK.

It just came to my notice your email on this issue sees below.

From the openwrt commit  d8b475212bbf9e5f80c1c923a9701dca5ceb23e2
and binding yaml  [3]
https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/latest/source/Documentation/devicetree/bindings/usb/dwc2.yaml#L87

USB DWC2 power is linked to vbus-supply, so it should be moved to usb node.
Now I am getting your point correctly.

[    1.260460] dwc2 c90c0000.usb: Looking up vusb_d-supply property in
node /soc/usb@c90c0000 failed

[    1.260784] dwc2 c90c0000.usb: Looking up vbus-supply property in

Thanks for the input, I will update the vbus-supply in the next
version to USB nodes.
