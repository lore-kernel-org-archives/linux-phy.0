This series is a continuation of Nicolas Frattaroli's series, that does
major cleanups in the Mediatek UFS driver code and dt-bindings
and adds the support for the MT8196 SoC and its variants (MT8894 SoC).
This new revision of the series takes into account the remaining peer
reviews and issues reports for v9.

First, it fixes several build and check issues: kernel test report build
report [1], patch per patch compilation, dtbs_check warnings.

Second, regarding the opened issues in v9 on the dt-bindings patches
2 ("dt-bindings: ufs: mediatek,ufs: Complete the binding") and 3
("dt-bindings: ufs: mediatek,ufs: Add mt8196 variant") [2],
this revision has two major changes to address them:
1) It renames all the clock names starting with ufs_ prefix and the one
that was named "ufs". No driver changes is needed for those because
they are not explicitely used by their names. The ufs_sel and ufs_fde
clocks in the driver were not renamed because they are not present 
in the dt-bindings (not anymore for the ufs_sel).
The devicetree patches for MT8195 SoC dtsi and the Mediatek Genio
1200-EVK and Radxa NIO-12L boards were also added to match the changes
made by series.
2) It drops the addition of all crypto and ufs_sel clocks, as it seems the
most likely and best solution to [2] after investigating on them and
what they are used for ([3]).

The Reviewed-by and Acked-by trailers, got by the patches 2 and 3 in
previous series revisions, were dropped so these changes can be reviewed again. 

This new revision is based on linux-next kernel tree (tag:
next-20260729) and has been tested on Mediatek Genio 5100 Pro board
(that integrates a MT8894 SoC).

Original Nicolas Frattaroli's cover letter:

In this series, the existing MediaTek UFS binding is expanded and
completed to correctly describe not just the existing compatibles, but
also to introduce a new compatible in the from of the MT8196 SoC.

The resets, which until now were completely absent from both the UFS
host controller binding and the UFS PHY binding, are introduced to both.
This also means the driver's undocumented and, in mainline, unused reset
logic is reworked. In particular, the PHY reset is no longer a reset of
the host controller node, but of the PHY node.

This means the host controller can reset the PHY through the common PHY
framework.

The resets remain optional.

Additionally, a massive number of driver cleanups are introduced. These
were prompted by me inspecting the driver more closely as I was
adjusting it to correspond to the binding.

The driver still implements vendor properties that are undocumented in
the binding. I did not touch most of those, as I neither want to
convince the bindings maintainers that they are needed without knowing
precisely what they're for, nor do I want to argue with the driver
authors when removing them.

Due to the "Marie Kondo with a chainsaw" nature of the driver cleanup
patches, I humbly request that reviewers do not comment on displeasing
code they see in the context portion of a patch before they've read the
whole patch series, as that displeasing code may in fact be reworked in
a subsequent patch of this series. Please keep comments focused on the
changed lines of the diff; I know there's more that can be done, but it
doesn't necessarily need to be part of this series.

  - Aligned example to patch changes
  - Reworded commit message to drop ufs_sel clocks references

  declared in the ufs-mediatek.c file after use.
- Moved ufs_mtk_of_match symbol at original place in patch 8
- Fixed build failure reported by Kernel Test Robot on patch 19 by
  fixing the incorrect FIELD_MODIFY val argument and using GENMASK
  for MTK_UFS_VER_PREFIX_M definition
- Added patch 24, 25, 26 devicetree patches for MT8195 SoC, Mediatek
  Genio 1200-EVK and Radxa NIO-12L boards to match the dt-bindings
  changes introduced by this series
- Added reviewed-by tag for patch 21
- Link to v9: https://lore.kernel.org/r/20260306-mt8196-ufs-v9-0-55b073f7a830@collabora.com

Changes in v9:
- Eliminate build failure in "Remove undocumented downstream reset
  cruft", including the of_node_put of the reset node that wasn't caught
- Pointlessly rename per-instance hibernate timer backup member to
  "ahit"
- Link to v8: https://lore.kernel.org/r/20260304-mt8196-ufs-v8-0-5b0eac23314f@collabora.com

Changes in v8:
- Split "Rework probe function" into two, turn the reset removal into
  its own patch and squash the PHY changes into the common PHY framework
  patch.
- Leave "device reset done" logging print at INFO level
- Remove redundant falsy check for reg_vcore in "Don't acquire
  dvfsrc-vcore twice".
- Change ufs_mtk_wait_idle_state to early-exit on all non-HIB states,

Changes in v7:
- Rebase onto next-20260205, which drops "scsi: ufs: mediatek: Switch to
  newer PM ops helpers" as Arnd sent an equivalent patch that also fixes
  the PM-less build failure.
- Link to v6: https://lore.kernel.org/r/20260124-mt8196-ufs-v6-0-e7c005b60028@collabora.com

- Don't disable/enable misc regulators during suspend/resume, but enable
  them once when acquiring with a devm helper.
- Link to v4: https://lore.kernel.org/r/20251218-mt8196-ufs-v4-0-ddec7a369dd2@collabora.com

Changes in v4:
- bindings: Redo the supply situation, as the avdd pins don't describe
  the vcc(q2) card supplies.
- bindings: format clock in mt8196 example more tersely.
- phy: use devm_reset_control_get_optional_exclusive directly
- driver: get and enable/disable the aforementioned avdd supplies.
- Link to v3: https://lore.kernel.org/r/20251023-mt8196-ufs-v3-0-0f04b4a795ff@collabora.com

Changes in v3:
- Split mediatek,ufs bindings change into two patches, one for
  completing the existing binding, one for the MT8196
- Add over a dozen driver cleanup patches
- Add explicit support for the MT8196 compatible to the driver
- Note: next-20251023, on which I based this, currently has a broken
  build due to an unrelated OPP core change that was merged with no
  build testing. I can't use next-20251022 either, as that lacks the
  recent mediatek UFS changes. It is what it is.
- Link to v2: https://lore.kernel.org/r/20251016-mt8196-ufs-v2-0-c373834c4e7a@collabora.com
