I understand that this looks like we're trashing all the work that was
done previously by removing the current driver and adding the new one
but the logic for deciding what to write into registers was carefully
preserved from the original driver to make sure that the works of
stabilization and maintenance are not lost.

However I would understand that my good promise on this is not enough,
so perhaps I could provide a combinatory verification that the same set
of mbus/pixel formats end up with the same thing being written into
registers.

In addition I understand that it will be necessary to split the changes
up into small commits to clarify the transition path between the two
drivers. So I will do my best to split things up.

Does that seem like an agreeable plan or do you see other things that
would be blockers?

My initial thought was that it would be much easier to review the driver as=
 a
rewrite, but I'm not too surprised I was wrong. To be honest it was nearly
impossible to actually have the initial development happen as sequential st=
eps
and I preferred to allocate my time on other tasks than splitting the chang=
es
into these sequential steps.

Cheers,

Paul
