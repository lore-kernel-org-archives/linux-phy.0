Clearly, the PHY needs at least 50uS to perform software reset (SW_RST) of
the digital (controller? my brain doesn't want to cooperate on giving the
right word right now, sorry), so we sleep that time after asserting the
reset bit to comply with this timing.

I understand the fact that the PHY is part of the entire block, but you cannot
guarantee that the next block will have an entirely different PHY and also an
entirely different port IP.

I will pretty much oversimplify this as to make sure that you understand the
strategy and concerns that I have in mind, and why I think that this should
still be probed separately with its own device-tree compatible:

1. The DisplayPort IP that we have in MT8195 is composed of
A - DisplayPort PHY, let's give it a fantasy version V1.0
B - DisplayPort "port" IP, also fantasy version V1.0

2. DisplayPort IP in a future MT9988 chip may be composed of
A - DisplayPort PHY, V1.0
B - DisplayPort "port" IP, V1.1, maybe in a different iospace

3. Of course, it may happen that MT9999 chip may have a variant of the one in 9988
A - DisplayPort PHY, V1.01, maybe in a different iospace
B - DisplayPort "port" IP, V1.1

In cases 2, 3, having both drivers probed as I suggest, will allow to not only
specify a different iospace (which may not be contiguous anymore!), but also to
avoid specifying a different compatible string for one of the two components
which are not carrying any variation in the register layout and/or management.

This, in turn, will also make it easier for developers reading the SoC device
trees to get more immediate knowledge of the hardware, but of course this is not
a primary reason, but more like a side-benefit.

P.S.: As for "holes in the middle", remember that device-tree supports "ranges"!
