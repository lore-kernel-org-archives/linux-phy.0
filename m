Argh, the headers, forgot about them! I was hoping there would only be a
complaint about the undocumented compatible strings, and I didn't want to
tie the three series together unnecessarily, to avoid a harder to handle
28-patch series.

I hope this doesn't prevent actual review by people, my github has
the combined story, in case people want to avoid the issue:
