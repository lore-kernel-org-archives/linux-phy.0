No, because these defines are the 1 mode used for a specific connection, 
not the set of supported modes.

There is also 'phy-type' to set the mode/type in the provider.

If we need to list all possible modes, then you need to justify why 
that's needed and then define a property which is a mask of the 
existing type defines.

I don't follow the need for fixed-mode, but agree you should use a phy 
arg. Can't you just assume the D-PHY only instance will only have D-PHY 
for the arg?
