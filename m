Maybe something like this, which simply alters the documentation to
indicate that phy_set_mode*() is permissible prior to phy_power_on(),
and should be used at that point where drivers know the mode which
will be used.

Leaving the existing phy_set_mode*() in the sequence also indicates
that it's permissible to call this while the PHY is still powered
on.

For drivers such as stmmac, it will be important that details such as
whether phy_est_mode*() can be called with the PHY powered on are
riveted down and not left up to the generic PHY driver author - without
that, generic PHYs basically aren't usable from SoC/platform
independent code, and stmmac has bazillions of platform specific glue
already because of (a) bad code structuring and (b) lack of
generalisation through standardised interfaces that abstract platform
differences.

I want to be able for core stmmac code, or even phylink code (which
is even more platform generic) to be able to make use of generic PHY
stuff, but if the calls that can be made into generic PHY are platform
dependent, that is a blocking issue against that, and makes me question
why we have the generic PHY subsystem... it's not very generic if it
exposes the differences of each implementation to users of its
interfaces.

I think generic PHY has had the idea that its interfaces will only be
used from platform specific code that knows about the behaviour of it's
generic PHY driver, but as can be seen above, this will not remain the
case given that we have hardware designs where the core of the driver
is one vendor's IP that gets re-used across many different platforms,
but the SerDes PHY is one of many other vendor's IP.
