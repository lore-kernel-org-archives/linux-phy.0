Maxime is right in the sense that uAPI can always be extended, but it
has to be done in a backward-compatible manner, and staging is sometimes
considered as not being covered by the ABI stability requirements of the
kernel. Not everybody agrees on this, but there are clear cases where
userspace really can't expect staging ABIs to be stable (for instance
when the driver doesn't even compile).

I think there's value in having the driver in staging to facilitate
development until we consider the ABI stable, but I'm not entirely sure
if there should be another step taken to mark this ABI is not being
ready yet.

Can documentation in staging be compiled ? If not I think it can go to
Documentation/
