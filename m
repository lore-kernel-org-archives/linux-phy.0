This question is still open.
Even with all your explanations below I am missing a way to verify if
GPIOAO_5 is the correct GPIO to use.

no worries, that's why I mentioned that it's low priority

This means that whatever is configured in the .dts is also showing up
in debugfs.
It doesn't mean that the correct GPIO or polarity is used -> that is
why I want to understand how to actually test this patch.
Technically I can write a patch that makes GPIOAO_13 (which is
connected to the status LED) show up as being used by
regulator-usb-pwr-en in debugfs.

This sentence is not correct
From drivers/phy/phy-core.c:
    phy->pwr = regulator_get_optional(&phy->dev, "phy");

As you can see, the "phy-supply" regulator is marked as optional in
the PHY subsystem.
This matches with
Documentation/devicetree/bindings/phy/phy-bindings.txt where
"phy-supply" is marked as an optional property.

> e841ec956e53 ("ARM64: dts: meson-gxbb-odroidc2: fix usb1 power supply")
That commit is from 2017. You'll also find some commits where I am
also using the phy-supply property (I didn't know better back then).
However, in 2018 things changed when the dwc2 driver gained a
vbus-supply property in commit 531ef5ebea9639 ("usb: dwc2: add support
for host mode external vbus supply")
So for new .dts support phy-supply should not be used anymore for VBUS
because phy-supply (described as "Phandle to a regulator that provides
power to the PHY." in
Documentation/devicetree/bindings/phy/phy-bindings.txt) and
vbus-supply are two different things.


Best regards,
Martin
