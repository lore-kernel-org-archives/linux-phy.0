I'm sorry, but I don't have time to continue this discussion today. I
woke late, we're trying to cram in the meals (in the middle of delayed
lunch-time dinner right now), work wants a quick call to discuss a
project that I missed the meeting for yesterday (which I haven't yet
had time for...)

Sorry, but while you may wish to get this sorted, for me this is a very
low priority issue that can be addressed later. Don't think I will have
time to review anything you send - and that's not a personal attack,
it's because I'm barely managing to hold everything together at my
end, and I don't have the time.
